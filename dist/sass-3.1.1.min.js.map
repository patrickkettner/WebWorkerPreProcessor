New Sass functions can be added by adding Ruby methods to this module.\n  # For example:\n  #\n  #     module Sass::Script::Functions\n  #       def reverse(string)\n  #         assert_type string, :String\n  #         Sass::Script::String.new(string.value.reverse)\n  #       end\n  #       declare :reverse, :args => [:string]\n  #     end\n  #\n  # Calling {declare} tells Sass the argument names for your function.\n  # If omitted, the function will still work, but will not be able to accept keyword arguments.\n  # {declare} can also allow your function to take arbitrary keyword arguments.\n  #\n  # There are a few things to keep in mind when modifying this module.\n  # First of all, the arguments passed are {Sass::Script::Literal} objects.\n  # Literal objects are also expected to be returned.\n  # This means that Ruby values must be unwrapped and wrapped.\n  #\n  # Most Literal objects support the {Sass::Script::Literal#value value} accessor\n  # for getting their Ruby values.\n  # Color objects, though, must be accessed using {Sass::Script::Color#rgb rgb},\n  # {Sass::Script::Color#red red}, {Sass::Script::Color#blue green}, or {Sass::Script::Color#blue blue}.\n  #\n  # Second, making Ruby functions accessible from Sass introduces the temptation\n  # to do things like database access within stylesheets.\n  # This is generally a bad idea;\n  # since Sass files are by default only compiled once,\n  # dynamic code is not a great fit.\n  #\n  # If you really, really need to compile Sass on each request,\n  # first make sure you have adequate caching set up.\n  # Then you can use {Sass::Engine} to render the code,\n  # using the {file:SASS_REFERENCE.md#custom-option `options` parameter}\n  # to pass in data that {EvaluationContext#options can be accessed}\n  # from your Sass functions.\n  #\n  # Within one of the functions in this module,\n  # methods of {EvaluationContext} can be used.\n  #\n  # ### Caveats\n  #\n  # When creating new {Literal} objects within functions,\n  # be aware that it's not safe to call {Literal#to_s #to_s}\n  # (or other methods that use the string representation)\n  # on those objects without first setting {Node#options= the #options attribute}.\n  module Functions\n    @signatures = {}\n\n    # A class representing a Sass function signature.\n    #\n    # @attr args [Array<Symbol>] The names of the arguments to the function.\n    # @attr var_args [Boolean] Whether the function takes a variable number of arguments.\n    #

This includes the names of the arguments,\n    # whether the function takes a variable number of arguments,\n    # and whether the function takes an arbitrary set of keyword arguments.\n    #\n    # It's not necessary to declare a signature for a function.\n    # However, without a signature it won't support keyword arguments.\n    #\n    # A single function can have multiple signatures declared\n    # as long as each one takes a different number of arguments.\n    # It's also possible to declare multiple signatures\n    # that all take the same number of arguments,\n    # but none of them but the first will be used\n    # unless the user uses keyword arguments.\n    #\n    # @param method_name [Symbol] The name of the method\n    #   whose signature is being declared.\n    # @param args [Array<Symbol>] The names of the arguments for the function signature.\n    # @option options :var_args [Boolean] (false)\n    #   Whether the function accepts a variable number of (unnamed) arguments\n    #   in addition to the named arguments.\n    # @option options :var_kwargs [Boolean] (false)\n    #   Whether the function accepts other keyword arguments\n    #   in addition to those in `:args`.\n    #   If this is true, the Ruby function will be passed a hash from strings\n    #   to {Sass::Script::Literal}s as the last argument.\n    #   In addition, if this is true and `:var_args` is not,\n    #

The -o option can change the output filename.\n#\n# == Writing A Racc Grammar File\n#\n# If you want your own parser, you have to write a grammar file.\n# A grammar file contains the name of your parser class, grammar for the parser,\n# user code, and anything else.\n# When writing a grammar file, yacc's knowledge is helpful.\n# If you have not used yacc before, Racc is not too difficult.\n#\n# Here's an example Racc grammar file.\n#\n#   class Calcparser\n#   rule\n#     target: exp { print val[0] }\n#\n#     exp: exp '+' exp\n#        | exp '*' exp\n#        | '(' exp ')'\n#        | NUMBER\n#   end\n#\n# Racc grammar files resemble yacc files.\n# But (of course), this is Ruby code.\n# yacc's $$ is the 'result', $0, $1... is\n# an array called 'val', and $-1, $-2... is an array called '_values'.\n#\n# See the {Grammar File Reference}[rdoc-ref:lib/racc/rdoc/grammar.en.rdoc] for\n# more information on grammar files.\n#\n# == Parser\n#\n# Then you must prepare the parse entry method. There are two types of\n# parse methods in Racc, Racc::Parser#do_parse and Racc::Parser#yyparse\n#\n# Racc::Parser#do_parse is simple.\n#\n# It's yyparse() of yacc, and Racc::Parser#next_token is yylex().\n# This method must returns an array like [TOKENSYMBOL, ITS_VALUE].\n# EOF is [false, false].\n# (TOKENSYMBOL is a Ruby symbol (taken from String#intern) by default.\n# If you want to change this, see the grammar reference.\n#\n# Racc::Parser#yyparse is little complicated, but useful.\n# It does not use Racc::Parser#next_token, instead it gets tokens from any iterator.\n#\n# For example, <code>yyparse(obj, :scan)</code> causes\n# calling +obj#scan+, and you can return tokens by yielding them from +obj#scan+.\n#\n# == Debugging\n#\n# When debugging, \"-v\" or/and the \"-g\" option is helpful.\n#\n# \"-v\" creates verbose log file (.output).\n# \"-g\" creates a \"Verbose Parser\".\n# Verbose Parser prints the internal status when parsing.\n# But it's _not_ automatic.\n# You must use -g option and set +@yydebug+ to +true+ in order to get output.\n# -g option only creates the verbose parser.\n#\n# === Racc reported syntax error.\n#\n# Isn't there too many \"end\"?\n# grammar of racc file is changed in v0.10.\n#\n# Racc does not use '%' mark, while yacc uses huge number of '%' marks..\n#\n# === Racc reported \"XXXX conflicts\".\n#\n# Try \"racc -v xxxx.y\".\n# It causes producing racc's internal log file, xxxx.output.\n#\n# === Generated parsers does not work correctly\n#\n# Try \"racc -g xxxx.y\".\n# This command let racc generate \"debugging parser\".\n# Then set @yydebug=true in your parser.\n# It produces a working log of your parser.\n#\n# == Re-distributing Racc runtime\n#\n# A parser, which is created by Racc, requires the Racc runtime module;\n# racc/parser.rb.\n#\n# Ruby 1.8.x comes with Racc runtime module,\n# you need NOT distribute Racc runtime files.\n#\n# If you want to include the Racc runtime module with your parser.\n# This can be done by using '-E' option:\n#\n#   $ racc -E -omyparser.rb myparser.y\n#\n# This command creates myparser.rb which `includes' Racc runtime.\n# Only you must do is to distribute your parser file (myparser.rb).\n#\n# Note: parser.rb is LGPL, but your parser is not.\n# Your own parser is completely yours.\nmodule Racc\n\n  unless defined?(Racc_No_Extensions)\n    Racc_No_Extensions = false # :nodoc:\n  end\n\n  class Parser\n\n    Racc_Runtime_Version = '1.4.6'\n    Racc_Runtime_Revision = %w$originalRevision: 1.8 $[1]\n\n    Racc_Runtime_Core_Version_R = '1.4.6'\n    Racc_Runtime_Core_Revision_R = %w$originalRevision: 1.8 $[1]\n    # DISABLED: opal has no racc/cparse\n    # begin\n    #   require 'racc/cparse'\n    # # Racc_Runtime_Core_Version_C  = (defined in extension)\n    #   Racc_Runtime_Core_Revision_C = Racc_Runtime_Core_Id_C.split[2]\n    #   unless new.respond_to?(:_racc_do_parse_c, true)\n    #     raise LoadError, 'old cparse.so'\n    #   end\n    #   if Racc_No_Extensions\n    #     raise LoadError, 'selecting ruby version of racc runtime core'\n    #   end\n    #\n    #   Racc_Main_Parsing_Routine    = :_racc_do_parse_c # :nodoc:\n    #   Racc_YY_Parse_Method         = :_racc_yyparse_c # :nodoc:\n    #   Racc_Runtime_Core_Version    = Racc_Runtime_Core_Version_C # :nodoc:\n    #   Racc_Runtime_Core_Revision   = Racc_Runtime_Core_Revision_C # :nodoc:\n    #   Racc_Runtime_Type            = 'c' # :nodoc:\n    # rescue LoadError\n      Racc_Main_Parsing_Routine    = :_racc_do_parse_rb\n      Racc_YY_Parse_Method         = :_racc_yyparse_rb\n      Racc_Runtime_Core_Version    = Racc_Runtime_Core_Version_R\n      Racc_Runtime_Core_Revision   = Racc_Runtime_Core_Revision_R\n      Racc_Runtime_Type            = 'ruby'\n    # end\n\n    def Parser.racc_runtime_type # :nodoc:\n      Racc_Runtime_Type\n    end\n\n    def _racc_setup\n      @yydebug = false unless self.class::Racc_debug_parser\n      @yydebug = false unless defined?(@yydebug)\n      if @yydebug\n        @racc_debug_out = $stderr unless defined?(@racc_debug_out)\n        @racc_debug_out ||= $stderr\n      end\n      arg = self.class::Racc_arg\n      arg[13] = true if arg.size < 14\n      arg\n    end\n\n    def _racc_init_sysvars\n      @racc_state  = [0]\n      @racc_tstack = []\n      @racc_vstack = []\n\n      @racc_t = nil\n      @racc_val = nil\n\n      @racc_read_next = true\n\n      @racc_user_yyerror = false\n      @racc_error_status = 0\n    end\n\n    # The entry point of the parser.
