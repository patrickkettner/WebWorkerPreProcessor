Generally spelling is based on the browser\'s language, not the language of the document.',notes_by_num:{},usage_perc_y:45.5,usage_perc_a:51.51,ucprefix:!1,parent:"",keywords:"spelling",ie_id:"",chrome_id:"",firefox_id:"",webkit_id:""},fullscreen:{title:"Full Screen API",description:"API for allowing content (like a video or canvas element) to take up the entire screen.",spec:"https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/",status:"ls",links:[{url:"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Using_full-screen_mode",title:"MDN article"},{url:"http://jlongster.com/2011/11/21/canvas.html",title:"Blog post"},{url:"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/01/using-the-fullscreen-api-in-web-browsers/",title:"Mozilla hacks article"},{url:"http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/dom/Element/requestFullscreen",title:"WebPlatform Docs"}],categories:["JS API"],stats:{ie:{6:"n",7:"n",8:"n",9:"n",10:"n",11:"a x #3",5.5:"n"},edge:{12:"a #3",13:"a #3",14:"a #3"},firefox:{2:"n",3:"n",4:"n",5:"n",6:"n",7:"n",8:"n",9:"n",10:"a x #1 #3",11:"a x #1 #3",12:"a x #1 #3",13:"a x #1 #3",14:"a x #1 #3",15:"a x #1 #3",16:"a x #1 #3",17:"a x #1 #3",18:"a x #1 #3",19:"a x #1 #3",20:"a x #1 #3",21:"a x #1 #3",22:"a x #1 #3",23:"a x #1 #3",24:"a x #1 #3",25:"a x #1 #3",26:"a x #1 #3",27:"a x #1 #3",28:"a x #1 #3",29:"a x #1 #3",30:"a x #1 #3",31:"a x #1 #3",32:"a x #1 #3",33:"a x #1 #3",34:"a x #1 #3",35:"a x #1 #3",36:"a x #1 #3",37:"a x #1 #3",38:"a x #1 #3",39:"a x #1 #3",40:"a x #1 #3",41:"a x #1 #3",42:"a x #1 #3",43:"a x #1 #3",44:"a x #1 #3",45:"a x #1 #3",46:"a x #1 #3",47:"a x #1 #3 #4",48:"a x #1 #3 #4",49:"a x #1 #3 #4",50:"a x #1 #3 #4",51:"a x #1 #3 #4",52:"a x #1 #3 #4",3.5:"n",3.6:"n"},chrome:{4:"n",5:"n",6:"n",7:"n",8:"n",9:"n",10:"n",11:"n",12:"n",13:"n",14:"n",15:"a x #1 #3",16:"a x #1 #3",17:"a x #1 #3",18:"a x #1 #3",19:"a x #1 #3",20:"a x #2 #3",21:"a x #2 #3",22:"a x #2 #3",23:"a x #2 #3",24:"a x #2 #3",25:"a x #2 #3",26:"a x #2 #3",27:"a x #2 #3",28:"a x #2 #3",29:"a x #2 #3",30:"a x #2 #3",31:"a x #2 #3",32:"a x #2 #3",33:"a x #2 #3",34:"a x #2 #3",35:"a x #2 #3",36:"a x #2 #3",37:"a x #2 #3",38:"a x #2 #3",39:"a x #2 #3",40:"a x #2 #3",41:"a x #2 #3",42:"a x #2 #3",43:"a x #2 #3",44:"a x #2 #3",45:"a x #2 #3",46:"a x #2 #3",47:"a x #2 #3",48:"a x #2 #3",49:"a x #2 #3",50:"a x #2 #3",51:"a x #2 #3",52:"a x #2 #3",53:"a x #2 #3",54:"a x #2 #3",55:"a x #2 #3",56:"a x #2 #3",57:"a x #2 #3"},safari:{4:"n",5:"n",6:"a x #2 #3",7:"a x #2 #3",8:"a x #2 #3",9:"a x #2 #3",10:"a x #2 #3",3.1:"n",3.2:"n",5.1:"a x #1 #3",6.1:"a x #2 #3",7.1:"a x #2 #3",9.1:"a x #2 #3",TP:"a x #2 #3"},opera:{9:"n",11:"n",12:"n",15:"a x #2 #3",16:"a x #2 #3",17:"a x #2 #3",18:"a x #2 #3",19:"a x #2 #3",20:"a x #2 #3",21:"a x #2 #3",22:"a x #2 #3",23:"a x #2 #3",24:"a x #2 #3",25:"a x #2 #3",26:"a x #2 #3",27:"a x #2 #3",28:"a x #2 #3",29:"a x #2 #3",30:"a x #2 #3",31:"a x #2 #3",32:"a x #2 #3",33:"a x #2 #3",34:"a x #2 #3",35:"a x #2 #3",36:"a x #2 #3",37:"a x #2 #3",38:"a x #2 #3",39:"a x #2 #3",40:"a x #2 #3",41:"a x #2 #3",42:"a x #2 #3","9.5-9.6":"n","10.0-10.1":"n",10.5:"n",10.6:"n",11.1:"n",11.5:"n",11.6:"n",12.1:"y"},ios_saf:{8:"n",10:"n",3.2:"n","4.0-4.1":"n","4.2-4.3":"n","5.0-5.1":"n","6.0-6.1":"n","7.0-7.1":"n","8.1-8.4":"n","9.0-9.2":"n",9.3:"n"},op_mini:{all:"n"},android:{3:"n",4:"n",53:"n",2.1:"n",2.2:"n",2.3:"n",4.1:"n",
